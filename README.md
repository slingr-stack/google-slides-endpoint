# Google Slides endpoint

## Overview

The Google Slides endpoint is a user endpoint (see [Global vs user endpoints](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/app_development_model_endpoints.html#global-vs-user-endpoints)), 
which means that each user should connect to the endpoint.

This endpoint allows direct access to the [Google Slides API](https://developers.google.com/slides/reference/rest),
however it provides shortcuts and helpers for most common use cases.

Some of the features available in this endpoint are:

- Authentication and authorization
- Direct access to the Google Slides API
- Helpers for API methods

For more information please refer to [docs](https://slingr-stack.github.io/platform/endpoints_google_slides.html).
